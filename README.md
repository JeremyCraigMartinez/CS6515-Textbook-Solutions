# About

This repository is my way of tracking solutions to the example problems from [Algorithms](https://books.google.com/books?id=DJSUCgAAQBAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PP1&dq=Algorithms%20Dasgupta&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=Algorithms%20Dasgupta&f=false) by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou, Umesh Vazirani. I will only be addressing only a handful of problems from

- Chapter 6 - Dynamic Programming
- Chapter 2 - Divide and Conquer
- Chapter 3 - Decomposition of Graphs
- Chapter 4 - Paths in Graphs
- Chapter 7 - Linear Programming and Reductions
- Chapter 8 - NP-complete Problems

As these are the topics covered in Georgia Tech's OMSCS [CS 6516](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6515-intro-graduate-algorithms) general [course schedule](http://omscs.wikidot.com/courses:cs6515). I will be tackling these in order of the schedule (and above).

# Contributing

Please contribute!! I know there are some [other examples](https://github.com/raymondhfeng/Algorithms_DPV_Solutions/blob/master/main.pdf) of repos like this, but they are lacking (only one chapter from above is shown in that repo). To contribute, simply [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repo, make your changes, and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Guidelines for contributing

Note the patterns for answers to questions that are programmable.

- They are using [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later.
- They are using [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
    - They are also asserting at least one example of a sample input and expected output. For problems that provide this, the code asserts the behavior. For problems that the textbook does not (i.e. 6.2, a sample input is created by the developer).

### Pointing out incorrect/incomplete answers

This is a great way to contribute as well! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/JeremyCraigMartinez/CS6515-Textbook-Solutions/issues/new) and report any issues you uncover with solutions in this repo.

# Disclaimer

I have no affiliation with the authors of the textbook or staff at Georgia Tech. I'm somply a student trying to document my answers to these questions for later reference. Take my answers, and any answers from merged pull requests, with a grain of salt. Hopefully this serves as a tool for collaboration among fellow students.
